Recipe Project - The Odin Project
This is a recipe project created as part of my learning journey through The Odin Project. The project is built using HTML and serves as a foundation for a recipe-sharing platform. The main goal of this project is to practice and reinforce my HTML skills, as I realized I had forgotten many HTML concepts.

What’s Included:
HTML for structuring the content
Basic design with HTML tags and elements to display recipes
I have coded this project using Visual Studio Code (VSC) and will be uploading it to GitHub for version control and sharing.

Future Plans:
CSS will be added to style the project and make it visually appealing.
JavaScript will be implemented for enhanced functionality, such as interactive features and dynamic content.
This project is part of my ongoing learning process, and I’m excited to continue improving it as I work through CSS and JavaScript in the coming stages. The goal is to build a fully responsive and functional recipe website with a user-friendly interface.

Feel free to explore, and thank you for checking it out!
