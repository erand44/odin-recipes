# Project Overview

This is my fresh restart of **The Odin Project – Foundations Course**. I stopped coding for about a year and forgot a lot, so I archived my old project and decided to start again from the beginning.

This new repo is where I will relearn the basics of **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Git**, and rebuild my skills step by step.

---

## Goals

* Refresh my memory and relearn key web development basics
* Practice using Git the right way with clear commits
* Build the Odin projects again with cleaner, better code
* See my progress in a new, organized repository

---

## What This Repo Includes

* New versions of the Odin Foundations projects (starting with Recipes)
* Updated HTML and CSS
* Simple, clear code that shows my improvement
* Notes and changes as I relearn things

## Why I Archived the Old Repo

I wanted to keep my old work as a record, but not mix it with my new progress. Archiving it lets me start fresh while still being able to look back at where I started.

## Status

Currently working through the Foundations course again.
