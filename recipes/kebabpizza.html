    <h1>Kebabpizza</h1>

    <h3>
        Kebab pizza is a fusion dish that combines traditional pizza with the flavors of kebab. It typically features a pizza base topped with kebab-style meat (such as lamb, chicken, or beef), alongside classic pizza toppings like cheese, vegetables, and sauces. The dish is often served with a yogurt or garlic sauce, giving it a unique, savory twist. Kebab pizza is popular in many countries, particularly in Europe, where it blends the best of both kebab and pizza cultures.</h3>
